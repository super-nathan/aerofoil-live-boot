BUILD SCRIPT FOR AEROFOIL LIVE DISK
===================================


Right now this is a script to build predicatable results when building a Debian live .ISO

This script is designed to slightly idiot-proof the process, but mainly to give us baseline for making ISO's. For simplicity this script will be first written to create Wheezy based images, at a later time functionality will be added to build testing and unstable images. Walk before we run

**until this is removed the script is under deveolpment*


HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT
----------------------

clone it into a working directory

run:

    ./go.sh
    
    
drink beer and watch the world turn
